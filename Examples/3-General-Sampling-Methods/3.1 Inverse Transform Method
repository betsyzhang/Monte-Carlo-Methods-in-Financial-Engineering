% Example: Suppose we wish to draw N = 10^5 independent copies of a discrete r.v. 
% taking values 1, . . . , 5 with probabilities 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05, 0.35, respectively.

>> p = [0.2,0.3,0.1,0.05,0.35];
>> N = 10^5;
>> x = zeros(N,1);
>> for i=1:N
x(i) = min(find(rand<cumsum(p))); %draws from p
end
>> freq = hist(x,1:5)/N;
>>

% Suppose we want to sample from the density, f(x)=x+/2, 0<x<1.

>> N=1000;
>> x = zeros(N,1);
>> for i=1:N
x(i)=(sqrt(8*rand+1)-1)/2;
end
